# Differential_Privacy_in_Fraud_Transaction_Detection

This project adeptly addresses the intricate equilibrium between data privacy and fraud detection. It centers on the protection of individual privacy within the realm of aggregate statistics, a pivotal concern in data privacy. The key challenge here is to avert the unintended revelation of personal sensitive information from aggregated data releases, which necessitates the implementation of differential privacy techniques.

The strategy of the project involves the incorporation of differential privacy methods into the fraud detection process. By infusing controlled noise into the transaction data, these techniques ensure the confidentiality of individual transaction details, while still enabling efficient fraud analysis. The project employs advanced machine learning models, trained on both anonymized (with privacy considerations) and original (without privacy modifications) data, for detecting fraudulent activities. The efficacy of these models is evaluated using critical metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, with a focus on comparing their performance on datasets with and without privacy alterations.

This research underscores the effectiveness of differential privacy methods in bolstering privacy while not compromising on the efficiency of fraud detection. It showcases the essential balance between upholding privacy and executing robust security measures in fraud prevention tactics.

The data employed in this research is a synthetic dataset of credit card transactions, created using the "Faker" Python library.
