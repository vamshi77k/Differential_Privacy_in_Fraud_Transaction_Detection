# Differential_Privacy_in_Fraud_Transaction_Detection

In the landscape of data privacy and fraud detection, preserving individual pri- vacy within aggregated statistics poses a critical challenge. Unprotected releases of aggregate data may inadvertently reveal sensitive information about individu- als, prompting the need for differential privacy techniques. This project addresses such a challenge by employing differential privacy methods in fraud transaction detection, aiming to strengthen privacy while maintaining the efficacy of fraud detection mechanisms. By injecting controlled noise into transactional data, these methods shield individual transaction details, enabling meaningful fraud analysis. Specialized machine learning models tailored for fraud detection undergo training on both anonymized, privatized data and original non-privatized data. Evalua- tion metrics encompass precision, recall and F1-score, comparing performance across privatized and non-privatized datasets. The study illuminates the potential of differential privacy techniques in fortifying privacy without compromising the efficiency of fraud detection, emphasizing the intricate balance between privacy preservation and robust security measures within fraud mitigation strategies.
